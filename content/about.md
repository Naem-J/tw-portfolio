My name is Jeff Naemura. I am a professional technical writer with a natural curiosity in how new technologies can  improve my work--whether that is in processes or content development. I'm passionate about the perspective I bring to a project team and believe in advocating for the intended audience at all times. I strive to uphold a high level of quality in my work while also pursuing opportunities to elevate the overall user experience through collaboration and teamwork.

Outside of technical writing, I am a husband and a father of two young boys. I enjoy watching baseball and movies.
